Materials for an activity using BAGPIPES to build intuition on galaxy properties.

Includes data, a `blackbox.py` module with functions that should stay hidden from you and two jupyter notebooks intended to run on [google colab](https://colab.google).

1. Lesson 1: 
    Introduces the galaxy modelling code [`bagpipes`](https://github.com/ACCarnall/bagpipes) and the necessary concepts for creating fake galaxies.
    Notebook: `galaxy_models.ipynb`

2. Lesson 2:
    In this lesson, we use `bagpipes` to compare models with observations and measure the properties of a real galaxy.
    Notebook: `measuring_galaxy_properties.ipynb`
